## Data Flow Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via AuthView
2. API client sends request via `auth.js`
3. Backend validates and returns session token
4. Token stored in HTTP-only cookie
5. AuthStore updated with user information
6. Protected routes verify authentication

### Task Management Flow
1. TasksView renders task list from taskStore
2. User creates/updates task via TaskOverlay
3. Request sent through `tasks.js` API client
4. Backend persists changes
5. TaskStore updated with new state
6. Components re-render with updated data

### State Update Pattern
1. Component triggers action/event
2. API call made through service module
3. Response received and processed
4. Store context updated
5. Subscribed components re-render

## Animations and Graphics

### Animation Framework

The frontend implements sophisticated animations using **Framer Motion**, a production-ready animation library built on top of React. Animations are organized into reusable variants and transitions stored in the `src/animations/` directory.

#### Framer Motion Variants

**Authentication Transitions** (`authVariants.js`):
- Card entrance/exit with 3D flip effects (rotateX transforms)
- Scale and opacity transforms for smooth appearance
- Staggered form field animations (0.06s stagger)
- Exit animations with reverse stagger timing
- Custom easing curves for brutalist design feel

**Page Transitions** (`variants.js`):
- "Building effect" page entry with rotateX and scale
- Modern brutalist easing functions: `[0.23, 1, 0.32, 1]` for snappy starts and smooth finishes
- Shutter/wipe transitions for high-impact page changes
- Staggered child animations for sequential element appearance
- Exit animations with inverse transforms

**Transition Configurations** (`transitions.js`):
- Fast (150ms) transitions for UI feedback
- Normal (200ms) for standard interactions
- Smooth (300ms) for content changes
- Slow smooth (500ms) for emphasis
- Spring physics with configurable damping and stiffness
- Gentle spring for subtle bounce effects
- Bouncy spring for energetic interactions

#### Heavy Graphics - Three.js Liquid Mercury Component

The **LiquidMercury** (`LiquidMercury.jsx`) is a sophisticated WebGL component featuring advanced physics simulations rendered with Three.js:

**Technical Specifications**:
- **Multi-Threaded Physics**: Offloaded to dedicated [Web Workers](src/animations/physics.worker.js) to keep the main UI thread responsive.
- **Particle System**: Dynamic scaling (10,000+ for Desktop, ~800 for Mobile) using instanced meshes.
- **Physics Engine**:
  - Zero-copy data transfer via **Transferable Objects** (ArrayBuffers) at 60Hz.
  - Repulsion forces with 1.5 unit radius and spring-back dynamics.
  - 3D Simplex noise flow fields and organic wave propagation.
  - "Void Entry" system: Particles spawn in the deep background ($z = -100$) for a premium entry effect.

**Advanced Features**:
- Simplex noise (3D) for natural flow generation
- Ray-casting for mouse interaction
- Click-based particle repulsion with decay
- Viewport-aware particle generation
- Phase-offset particle motion for organic movement
- Origin spring-back for particle clustering

**Rendering Pipeline**:
- Canvas-based Three.js renderer with React Three Fiber
- Particle instancing for performance optimization
- Custom shader-based particle updates
- Environmental lighting integration
- Real-time frame updates (useFrame hook)

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Consistent 60 FPS**: Achieved through multi-threading and GPU-accelerated rendering.
- **Hardware-Aware Scaling**: Automatic adjustment of geometry quality and particle count based on CPU core count.
- **Mobile-Specific Tuning**: 
  - `mediump` precision fragment shaders for faster mobile pixel processing.
  - Locked Device Pixel Ratio (DPR=1.0) on mobile to prevent GPU thermal throttling.
  - Antialiasing disabled on high-PPI screens to reduce fragment shader overhead.
- **Efficient Memory**: Reusable geometries and memoized materials to minimize Garbage Collection (GC) pauses.

### Visual Graphics Components

#### TaskSchematic (`TaskSchematic.jsx`)

Minimalist task matrix visualization:
- Grid-based layout (12 cells in 4x3 configuration)
- Animated pulse indicator on select cells
- Responsive sizing with `clamp()` for fluid scaling
- Hover scale transform (1.02x) for interactivity
- Typography overlay with "MATRIX" text
- Border styling with theme-aware colors
- Background gradient effects

#### TeamSchematic (`TeamSchematic.jsx`)

Team engine visualization with motion:
- Avatar cluster display with negative margin overlap
- Animated "SYNCED" status badge with pulse effect
- Framer Motion progress bar with infinite reverse animation
- Throughput percentage display with dynamic calculations
- Abstract geometric corner accent (border-based)
- Responsive layout adapting to screen sizes
- Horizontal flow animation representing team synchronization

#### LampComputer (`LampComputer.jsx`)

Stylized brutalist terminal aesthetic:
- CSS-based lamp neck structure with border styling
- Terminal screen with:
  - Realistic scan lines using CSS gradients
  - RGB color channel separation effect
  - Glow overlay for CRT monitor feel
  - System status header with animated indicator
  - Multiple rectangular panel placeholders
  - Monospace typography for authentic terminal look
- Motion entry animation (fade + y-offset)
- Shadow effects for depth
- Theme-aware color schemes
- Fully responsive sizing using `clamp()` for fluidity

### CSS Visual Effects

**Scan Lines Effect**:
```css
background: linear-gradient(
  rgba(18,16,16,0) 50%,
  rgba(0,0,0,0.25) 50%
),
linear-gradient(
  90deg,
  rgba(255,0,0,0.06),
  rgba(0,255,0,0.02),
  rgba(0,0,255,0.06)
)
```
Creates authentic CRT monitor scan line appearance with RGB separation.

**Animations Applied**:
- `animate-pulse` - Pulsing opacity for status indicators
- Custom Framer Motion sequences for staggered reveals
- Hover transforms for interactive feedback
- Gradient background shifts for hover states

### Animation Performance Optimization

The application implements a "Performance-First" architecture for its sophisticated visual elements.

**Techniques Implemented**:
- **Web Worker Offloading**: All heavy physics and matrix calculations for the Liquid Mercury system are moved to a background thread.
- **Zero-Copy Transfers**: Uses `ArrayBuffer` transfers between threads to eliminate serialization overhead.
- **Device-Based Degradation**: Real-time detection of low-power devices to scale down animation complexity.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Heavy reliance on CSS `transform` and WebGL shaders to ensure smooth 60fps movement.
- **Lazy Loading & Suspense**: 3D assets and heavy components are loaded only when needed, ensuring the main UI is interactive instantly.
- **Resource Pooling**: Geometries and materials are cached and reused across the application.
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Full compliance with `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries.

### User Experience with Motion

Animations serve functional purposes:
- **Loading States**: Subtle pulse animations indicate pending actions
- **Feedback**: Scale and opacity changes confirm user interactions
- **Guidance**: Staggered animations draw attention to sequential steps
- **Hierarchy**: Motion emphasis highlights important elements
- **Polish**: Micro-interactions create refined, professional feel

## Performance Considerations

- Code splitting at route level
- Lazy loading of components
- Image optimization via Vite
- CSS tree-shaking with Tailwind
- HTTP-only cookies for session security

## Security Measures

- Session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- CSRF protection through backend
- Input validation in forms
- Protected API endpoints
- Secure password handling

## Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Ensure port 5173 is available

**API connection errors**
- Verify backend is running
- Check environment variables in `.env`
- Verify CORS configuration on backend

**Build failures**
